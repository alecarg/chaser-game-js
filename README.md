Dev Battle
====================

Dev Battle is a turn based javascript mini-game created by Alejandro Cargnelutti for the "Salmon Talks: Front End" event. In this game, you compete against other developers by coding your character's movement instructions in advance to the game playing out. Your character will then spawn in "The final showdown" with all the other players' characters, and it will attempt to survive the longest by trying to avoid being eaten by the "Chaser". Last person standing wins the Â£100 voucher prize.

Format of the event
====================

- People are introduced to Dev Battle at the beginning of the event.
- Five computers wait for players to sit down and participate throughout the event.
- Towards the end of the event, all the players' code get merged into "The final showdown".
- "The final showdown" is presented for everyone to watch, where the last person standing becomes the winner.

Build tools
====================
The code for the game does not use any CSS pre-processors or node processes. Portability and predictability were the main priorities when considering the tools to use, as the game needed to be fully functioning in under 4 weeks of non-office hours time, as it was developed in my spare time. We used http://htmlpreview.github.io/ to serve the game directly from the repository on the different computers that we had on the day of the event.
